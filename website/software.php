                This PHP framework provides a low-cost mechanism of developing interactive models,
                allowing the user to click on the highlighted words of the story to continue their course
                of action. From the programmer perspective, the definition of the story is easy and clean with
                basic HTML/PHP including certain calls to PHP funtion in the transitions, and these transitions are stored.
