                    This PHP framework provides a low-cost mechanism of developing interactive models, allowing the user to click on the highlighted words of the story to continue their course of action. From the programmer perspective, the definition of the story is easy
                    and clean with basic HTML/PHP including certain calls to PHP funtion in the transitions, and these transitions are stored.

                    <h4> Prerrequisites: </h4>
                    <p>
                        Monogatari has been created specifically to be a web page, even before a game. Therefore, to develop in Monogatari you need the same as to develop a web page. No installation is required, unless you want more advanced features as we will explain later.
                        You will need a text editor capable of editing HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Any text editor should be able to do this, but we recommend one with code syntax highlighting. Some recommended (and free) include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                        <li>Atom</li>
                        <li>Brackets</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Now, you can always open your graphic novel by clicking on the index.html file and opening it with your browser, however there are little aspects of Monogatari that work best when served through a web server. You don't need anything fancy for this, in
                        fact there is a perfectly good web server that you can download from the Chrome Store. As mentioned above, using a web server is completely optional, you can open your game with the browser as a file and it will work. OK, the web
                        server will allow you to test features like service workers, required for Monogatari offline support and asset preloading.
