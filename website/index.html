                <p>
                    The project DColbici3 (from Spanish title "Diseño Colaborativo para la promoción del bienestar en ciudades inteligentes inclusivas") addresses the design of interactive models as a low-cost mechanism for encouraging the participation of citizens for the
                    design of inclusive cities.

                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>

                    The project deals with how to consult citizens about things that have to do with the city in contexts where the opinion of citizens is needed. For example, a modification in the urban layout is proposed and there are several technically feasible possibilities
                    to carry it out. The expected result of the project is twofold: first, if the answer to questions is more credible because a greater understanding of the problem is achieved by the user, we will ask for concrete modifications or we
                    will ask for the opinions of citizens on what to do in different situations; second, an infrastructure that allows industry to create smart city solutions in a more efficient and less expensive way, facilitating experimentation, with
                    the ability to run test batteries deterministically. This development philosophy is what we call Virtual Living Lab. The hypothesis of the project is that the novel serves as a narrative that captures the user's attention and makes
                    them generate higher quality responses.

                    Tis project continues the idea of Virtual Living Lab as introduced in “Pablo Campillo-Sanchez, Jorge J. Gómez-Sanz, Juan A. Botía: PHAT: Physical Human Activity Tester. HAIS 2013: 41-50” and “Pablo Campillo-Sanchez, Jorge J. Gómez-Sanz:Agent Based Simulation
                    for Creating Ambient Assisted Living Solutions. PAAMS 2014: 319-322”.

                    Our purpose is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Consider the presentation of situations based on graphic novels as a method for compare aspects such as user acceptance, usability, involvement or quality of their responses, compared to other traditional proposals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The effort required to perform reasonable tests.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our working hypothesis is that an inexpensive computer based simulation can reduce the amount of expenses by reproducing the AAL environment in a computer simulation that includes not only the inhabitants of the environment but the AmI system as well.
                    This computer simulation is what we call Virtual Living Lab.

                    Virtual Living Labs is a concept still under evolution. The results we have now permit to affirm the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It permits researchers to perform experiments as tough as required, without a concern of damaging the users or affecting their privacy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any kind of sensor or actuator can be reproduced and integrated in such environment without a previous investment in existing software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Experiments are perfectly repeatable, so the creation of libraries of expected behaviors is possible. This reuse may potentially reduce the development costs of similar products by sharing the knowledge that a previous development acquired. Long term,
                        this also will have the advantage of increasing the quality of the products, since the amount of testing and considered situations for specific or generic collectives will be greater each time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For this to be a reality, the researcher must be able to develop indistinctly for this Virtual Living Lab and for the Real World. It is the software in the loop concept, that makes the same software run in the simulation to run in the real devices.
